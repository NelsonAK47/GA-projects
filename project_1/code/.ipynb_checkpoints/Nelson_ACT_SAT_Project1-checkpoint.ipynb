    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

    "According to Lovell and Mallinson (2022), the COVID-19 pandemic has induced numerous colleges and universities to implement test-optional admission policies. It was implemented out of safety measures during the pandemic. However, pre-pandemic era has seen various colleges and universities practiced this policy as a way to promote diversity and equity on campus. [[source]](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-test-optional-college-admissions-expanded-during-covid-19-pandemic) This includes the optional submission for SAT and ACT scores for students university admission. (Bhardwa, 2022) [[source]](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/what-does-test-optional-mean-us-university-applications). In addition, the number of universities and colleges with test-optional policies has nearly doubled from 713 to 1,350 since spring 2020. Therefore, many universities are inching towards the test-optional admission requirement as part of the new normal. Also, it could also lead to a more diverse pool of applicants. (Lovell and Mallinson, 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has also shown that GPA or grades are the best predictor of college performance and are not as heavily influenced as standardized exams by socioeconomic backgrounds such as income, parent education levels and race. (Kurlaender and Cohen, 2019) [[source]](https://edpolicyinca.org/publications/predicting-college-success-how-do-different-high-school-assessments-measure-2019). To validate the statement, a number of university-admitted student GPAs have been collected and inputted manually to the csv file as attached above. Due to data availability constraint, only student GPAs admitted to University of California campuses were collected to be investigated. [[source]](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/freshman-admit-data.html).

    "Here are some prompts to get you started with visualizations. Feel free to add additional visualizations as you see fit:\n",
    "1. Use Seaborn's heatmap with pandas `.corr()` to visualize correlations between all numeric features.\n",
    "    - Heatmaps are generally not appropriate for presentations, and should often be excluded from reports as they can be visually overwhelming. **However**, they can be extremely useful in identify relationships of potential interest (as well as identifying potential collinearity before modeling).\n",
    "    - Please take time to format your output, adding a title. Look through some of the additional arguments and options. (Axis labels aren't really necessary, as long as the title is informative).\n",
    "2. Visualize distributions using histograms. If you have a lot, consider writing a custom function and use subplots.\n",
    "    - *OPTIONAL*: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)\n",
    "         - Be thorough in your verbal description of these distributions.\n",
    "         - Be sure to back up these summaries with statistics.\n",
    "         - We generally assume that data we sample from a population will be normally distributed. Do we observe this trend? Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.\n",
    "3. Plot and interpret boxplots. \n",
    "    - Boxplots demonstrate central tendency and spread in variables. In a certain sense, these are somewhat redundant with histograms, but you may be better able to identify clear outliers or differences in IQR, etc.\n",
    "    - Multiple values can be plotted to a single boxplot as long as they are of the same relative scale (meaning they have similar min/max values).\n",
    "    - Each boxplot should:\n",
    "        - Only include variables of a similar scale\n",
    "        - Have clear labels for each variable\n",
    "        - Have appropriate titles and labels\n",
    "4. Plot and interpret scatter plots to view relationships between features. Feel free to write a custom function, and subplot if you'd like. Functions save both time and space.\n",
    "    - Your plots should have:\n",
    "        - Two clearly labeled axes\n",
    "        - A proper title\n",
    "        - Colors and symbols that are clear and unmistakable\n",
    "5. Additional plots of your choosing.\n",
    "    - Are there any additional trends or relationships you haven't explored? Was there something interesting you saw that you'd like to dive further into? It's likely that there are a few more plots you might want to generate to support your narrative and recommendations that you are building toward. **As always, make sure you're interpreting your plots as you go**."
